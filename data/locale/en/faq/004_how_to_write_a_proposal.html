<p>We have some notes you should keep in mind for your proposal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First check if thereâ€™s an idea you like on this page.</li>
  <li>Get in touch with the mentors mentioned in this idea to get into this topic and get answers to your questions.</li>
  <li>Define - maybe together with the mentor - some measurable milestones, so you can design a rough timetable.</li>
  <li>Refine and break down your milestones (maybe into stories), also together with the mentor.</li>
  <li>Try to estimate what stories you can work on within the GSoC period. Please keep in mind that we have 2 kinds of projects: full-time with 350 hours and half-time with 175 hours over 10 weeks.</li>
  <li>Use our application template to introduce yourself and describe your project. The resulting document you should upload to the Google Summer of Code program website.</li>
</ul>
