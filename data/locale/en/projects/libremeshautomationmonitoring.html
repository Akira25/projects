<p>Create a set of automated tasks to install services on a Raspberry Pi to meet the needs of small community-network with an administration/tech team, e.g. a set of commonly needed monitoring tools, such as Prometheus, Prometheus-node-exporter, Blackbox-exporter, Altermanager, Grafana, VPN and an editing map service.</p>

<p>Similar projects or packages:
https://gitlab.com/librerouter/miniserver
https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/tree/master/packages/altermundi-grafana</p>

<p>The use case is a growing fragmented network with islands of nodes and users; but with a collective management having an overarching vision on what is happening in the network and giving feedback to the users by the <a href="https://github.com/libremesh/lime-app">Lime-App</a>.</p>

<p>Create a set of Ansible roles to replicate the OpenWrt build-system, to speed-up the process of self-building images for OpenWrt and/or LibreMesh for newcomers, and to easily setup a dedicated machine, with the possibility to later extend the process of build to other automated tasks, like a pub-keys-exchange needed for configuring a VPN, or to update documentations or a webapp.
The Ansible roles would include tasks to build for: different architectures and targets; different OpenWrt and LibreMesh versions; keeping trace of devices with particular needs and related patches; keeping a local list of supported targets; provide a basic functionality to setup a VPN. This should also provide a main configuration file for each device, and the use of the main configuration tools available on LibreMesh, like +/etc/config/lime-*+ and especially +lime-macaddress+ files, “generic-uci-config, lime-asset” functionalities, and configurations and packages provided by community <a href="https://github.com/libremesh/network-profiles">network-profiles</a> or local packages.
These will be published and shared also on Ansible Galaxy or similar repository as a standalone project.</p>
