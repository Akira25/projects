<p>Retroshare already has a Web Interface, which communicates to the headless retroshare-service through the built-in Json API, and that is the result of work from previous GSoC sessions.
This interface needs to be completed, which may still need quite a lot of work. See https://github.com/retroshare/RSNewWebUI/.</p>
