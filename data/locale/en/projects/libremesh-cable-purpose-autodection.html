<p>When a community network router ethernet port is acting as a gateway to the
Internet or as a border to neighboring networks, the network configuration
usually needs to be changed from the default settings to accommodate for the
specific role.
A router ethernet port can be connected to the Internet, or connected to a dummy
wifi device for a point to point link, or connected to another router of the
same mesh network to expand mesh coverage.
All these cases would benefit of specific configuration. As of today handling
those configuration manually represents a barrier for communities without
technical experts who could understand and optimize the devices ethernet ports
configuration appropriately.
Most of the described situation could be detected at runtime through automatic
tests and the required configuration applied automatically, the goal of this
project is to develop the software needed to accomplish automatically to the
described needs.</p>
