<p>Retroshare contains a generic distributed database system (called GXS) which allows to share data between nodes,
in a way that is cryptographically secured (database access may be limited to circles of people, etc). This database
system is currently used for distributing forums and channels over the network. The GXS system also offers
the possibility to respond, submit comments, and vote over posts.</p>

<p>We would like to use it to create a service that
allows users to create a blog-like service, to which friend nodes subscribe so as to propagate the info over the
network. Depending on the applicant’s skills and motivation, such a plugin could offer one of the following similar
services: twitter (distributed micro-blogging), blog (distributed blogging), Wall (Facebook-style information sharing).</p>

<p>This is not an easy project, since GXS internals are hard to understand in the first place. But the devs are highly motivated to get it done.
This is definitely a full-time project.</p>

<h4 id="milestones">Milestones</h4>

<ul>
  <li>properly represent social network objects (posts,images,comments,…) using internal GXS primitives (Groups, Circles, Identities, etc).
This is to be discussed with the developers.</li>
  <li>create the plugin interface to the backend.</li>
  <li>create the GUI for the Wall/Twitter/Blog service (preferably Qt. Could be Json+web, but would add some complexity)</li>
  <li>implement the backend service, based on GXS interaction handles</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="preparationbonding">PREPARATION/BONDING</h5>

<ul>
  <li>get familiar with the Retroshare network</li>
  <li>understand how GXS works. A white paper is available here: https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01617423</li>
  <li>discuss possible options with the developers</li>
  <li>we only recruit applicants who made relevant pull requests to the project before the selection period begins. Ask for the key to the dev Tor node (retroshare.project@gmail.com) and meet the devs in the dev forum/chat rooms.</li>
</ul>
