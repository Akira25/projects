<p>The idea is to expose different endpoints to interact with the RetroShare database, creating databases, tables, relationsâ€¦
Then, make sure that this database will correctly work on a distributed network paradigm.</p>

<p>On this way, we could use libretroshare just as a library where to build decentralized apps easier. Would be much easy to implement any
use to the app, exploiting the already existing distributed features of RS.</p>
