<p>The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OLSR</code>) is an IP routing protocol optimized for mobile ad hoc networks, which can also be used on other wireless ad hoc networks.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OLSR</code> was one of the first protocols created nearly 20 years ago. For some use cases, it’s still a reliable and stable protocol and is still used in several wireless network communities.</p>

<p>However, further development and bug fixing is getting more and more complicated due to a legacy codebase. One step in the right direction would be to add automated building and testing as well as an easier release system.</p>

<h4 id="milestones">Milestones</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Find a test framework to enable automated testing for release candidates and add first tests</li>
  <li>Extend testing to modules and libs</li>
  <li>Develop workflows to run tests and build a release</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="preparationbonding">PREPARATION/BONDING</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Understand the current release process and identify steps.</li>
  <li>Find the modules that need to be released.</li>
  <li>Evaluate how to test releases. Probably unit tests are too complex, but you could add integration or end-to-end tests.</li>
  <li>Understand how we can use Github Actions or other tools can be used for continuous integration.</li>
  <li>Find tools that help monitor the code quality.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="coding-period">Coding Period</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Discuss with your mentors what parts need to be released</li>
  <li>Develop a method to test the software. We’ll use the results in a decision if we draft a new release.</li>
  <li>Adopt Makefiles and add scripts to enable continuous integration.</li>
</ul>
