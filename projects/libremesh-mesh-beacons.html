<p>Exchanging information between disconnected 802.11s peers is important because connection takes a lot of time and/or the signal quality is not enough to reliably connect but is enough to send/receive some packets.
In OpenWrt 802.11s implementation there is no known easy way to add and retrieve information in the beacons albeit the specification of 802.11s provides ways of adding custom information.
The contributor will have to study the Linux kernel implementation of 802.11s to double check if Linux provides a way to add information to the beacons and also a way to retrieve this custom information.</p>

<p>If there is no support in Linux then the project can take two paths:</p>

<ol>
  <li>develop and try to upstream 802.11s beacons customization to the Linux kernel.</li>
  <li>investigate current solutions to exchange information in disconnected radios (for example using packet injection/sniffing on monitor interfaces), and try to develop a prototype solution.</li>
</ol>
