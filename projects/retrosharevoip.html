<p>Retroshare already offers the possibility to talk using Voice/Video over IP, but
only as a toy system. It currently needs a skilled developer to integrate a
proper cross-platform video codec that would be capable of frame-rate
auto-adjustment and be robust to network delays. This is a challenging project
that needs a good understanding of how existing VoIP works and interacts with
the network layer, as well as a technical understanding of how video compression
works in general.</p>

<p>This project can be a “175 hours” project for a sufficiently skilled developer.</p>

<h4 id="milestones">Milestones</h4>

<ul>
  <li>find a suitable cross-plaform video codec</li>
  <li>handle auto-adjustment of bandwidth for video/sound with proper priority handling to avoid gaps</li>
  <li>implement proper GUI device selection and notifications</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="preparationbonding">PREPARATION/BONDING</h5>

<ul>
  <li>get familiar with the Retroshare network and existing VOIP code</li>
  <li>discuss possible options with the developers</li>
  <li>we only consider recruiting applicants who made a few relevant pull requests to the project first. In other words, you may consider meeting the devs on the dev chat room/forum,
  and do small scale contributions to the current VOIP graphical user interface for a start. Ask for the Retroshare Dev Tor node key in order to quickly reach these chat/forums.</li>
</ul>
