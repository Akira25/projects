The actual app is developed with Flutter and supports Android systems. However, Flutter framework gives
the possibility to build apps to different platforms from a single codebase.</p>

<ul>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other one is experiment with Flutter native desktop framework to distribute a binary for each platform.</p>
