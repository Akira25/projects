<p>Voctoweb is the software behind media.ccc.de and used for distributing video recordings of a lot of events. We forked their repo to set up our own video portal, <a href="https://media.freifunk.net">media.freifunk.net</a>. As there was only one user of this software for years, content pages and templates are mixed with the logic.</p>

<p>Goal of this project should be: We’re able to set up a new instance of voctoweb and add our own contents, designs and templates. Logical parts should be shared (in code) by all instances.</p>

<p>It may be hard to split the original project in a first step. But if we find a way to make it easy for others to customize the installation, that doesn’t matter.</p>
