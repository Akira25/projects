<p>The performance of IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) networks has been far from optimal, especially when multiple participants share the same channel in an uncoordinated manner. These wireless devices are limited to operating only within the unlicensed ISM band, and consequently, a critical component that determines the throughput of WiFi networks is resource allocation algorithms. Most of these algorithms rely on only one transmission parameter to adapt to the changing wireless environment, such as transmission rates [1] or power levels [2].</p>

<p>In Linux-based devices, the resource allocation is handled in the mac80211 kernel subsystem, restricting the development of such algorithms to the kernel space, which has its limitations and challenges. With this in mind, recent advancements at SupraCoNeX [3] have enabled annotation of transmission rate and power level from user space for Linux-based OpenWrt [4] access points, permitting precise control over the wireless transmission from user space. This capability has eased the research on resource allocation for better management of interference and a potential increase in spatial reuse, especially in a highly dense network. Therefore, this project aims to develop a joint resource allocator [5] in user space to increase aggregate throughput in WiFi mesh and access networks running on OpenWrt OS.</p>
