<p><strong>Create a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) module in rust which compatible to the two existing modules for Android &amp; iOS.</strong></p>

<p>Create a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) module in rust which compatible to the two existing modules for Android &amp; iOS.</p>

<p>Existing android BLE module:
<a href="https://github.com/qaul/qaul.net/tree/main/android/blemodule">https://github.com/qaul/qaul.net/tree/main/android/blemodule</a></p>

<p>It shall do the following things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Listen for BLE advertisements
    <ul>
      <li>detect neighbour nodes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Send BLE advertisement messages in regular intervals.</li>
  <li>send arbitrary binary data to nodes nearby.</li>
  <li>receive arbitrary binary data from nodes nearby.</li>
</ul>

<p>The module is independent and will communicate via protobuf to the controlling backend library libqaul.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BlueR</code> is the official Bluetooth low energy repository for rust.

<p>Prototypes with partial functionality already exist.</p>

<h2 id="about-qaul">About qaul</h2>

<p><a href="https://qaul.net">qaul</a> is an Internet independent wireless mesh communication app. To communicate P2P directly from device to device and mesh all interconnected devices together.
qaul.net interconnects Android, iOS, Linux, MacOS &amp; Windows devices via LAN, Bluetooth and Internet overlay connections.</p>

<p>qaul is written in rust, uses rust-libp2p internally and has a cross platform flutter GUI.</p>
