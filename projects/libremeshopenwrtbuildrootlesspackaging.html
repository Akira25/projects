<p>To contribute to LibreMesh most of the time one have to create a new module that
is usually shipped as an OpenWrt package. People that have been joining
LibreMesh development over time have been encountering a steep learning curve
especially packaging their modules, because of the complexity of OpenWrt
build-root. Those packages most of the time consists just of a couple of Lua or
shell scripts that doesn’t need cross-compiling and other advanced features
provided by OpenWrt build-root.</p>

<p>Providing a tool to create simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">opkg</code> archives without depending on the
build-root in those cases would help new developers to start contributing
without a steep learning barrier. Moreover such a tool would have much less
requirements that the OpenWrt build-root.</p>

<h4 id="milestones">Milestones</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Understand what is exactly an OPKG archive (compression, manifest…)</li>
  <li>Create a simple prototype of the out-of-build-root packager</li>
  <li>Test it with simple packages</li>
  <li>Complete the implementation, and test it with LibreMesh modules</li>
  <li>Document how to use the created tool</li>
</ul>
