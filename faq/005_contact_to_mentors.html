<p>We act as an umbrella organization, so there are a bunch of possibilities to contact mentors. Most of our mentors can be contacted via GitHub. Please try to contact your mentor first!</p>

<p>If you’re in doubt or don’t know the project location, ask our <a href="https://lists.freifunk.net/mailman/listinfo/wlanware-freifunk.net">international mailing list</a> or at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!DmXQbxcSxGYgXDYrBs:bau-ha.us?via=bau-ha.us">matrix</a>. Please keep in mind that people there don’t know the projects or your ideas in detail!</p>
